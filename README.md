# This code was part of a project in my Business Statistics class. I was tasked with copying code from Kaggle.com and I selected the NBA Players' Salary Prediction using multiple regression model by Koki Ando. The code compares the salaries of NBA players from 2017-2018 with their stats from the previous sesason (2016-2017). This comparison is made to investigate how player statistics impact salaries for the next year. The model takes into consideration a number of statistics, including per game stats, turnovers, and trustworthiness of the player according to their coach. The model is then used to predict JJ Redick's contract extenstion for the 2018-2019 season based on his stats during the 2017-2018 season.
